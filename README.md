# WARNING

The current state of this is very limited, and this is very much in **alpha**. Consider the API in complete flux.

It is completely possible that master will be completely broken at any given time until we hit a stable 1.x.

# elm-firebase

**elm-firebase** is a set of bindings between Elm (>= ?) 0.18 and Firebase 3.x.

## Goals

 - Follow the elm architecture.

## Example

Check out the [kitchen sink](./examples/kitchenSink/src/Main.elm) example.
